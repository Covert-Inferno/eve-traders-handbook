## EVE Traders Handbook

The **EVE Traders Handbook** is a multi-purpose web application for traders, importers, and manufacturers in the popular space MMORPG [EVE Online](http://www.eveonline.com/).

It allows players to see details of the ships, modules, drones and ammunition that are being lost by their fellow capsuleers within the systems/regions they select. In this way, traders can identify those items likely to be in high demand, and manufacturers can compare the cost of importing versus mining and manufacturing items locally.

It makes use of the EVE API, the [zKillboard](http://zkillboard.com/) API, and the [eve-central.com](http://eve-central.com/) API to track player losses and item costs.

### Requirements

**ETH** runs on PHP5.3 and uses the [Laravel PHP framework](http://laravel.com/) and its associated systems (Blade templates, Composer, Eloquent ORM). It requires a MySQL database.

### Installation

TBC.
